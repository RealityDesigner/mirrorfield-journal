# MirrorField Journal

**A self-reflective AI journaling tool that expands human awareness, emotional intelligence, and mental clarity.**  
Built by a neurodivergent systems thinker for anyone seeking to grow from the inside out.

## 🌱 Why It Exists

Modern life is overloaded with external input and disconnection from inner truth. Especially for neurodivergent minds like mine—living with ADHD, emotional burnout, and chronic overstimulation—there’s a need for tools that actually *meet you where you are* and help you come back to yourself.

**MirrorField Journal** was born out of my lived experience. It’s an evolving AI-powered reflection system that invites you into deeper awareness, resonance-based decision making, and inner alignment. It’s not a productivity app. It’s a personal field-expansion tool.

## 🔍 What It Does (Eventually)

This tool guides you to:

- Reflect through intelligent, emotionally attuned journaling prompts
- Track inner states over time (mood, themes, insights)
- Surface unconscious patterns for self-awareness
- Anchor new thought pathways through repeat resonance
- Support your mental/emotional nervous system through interaction

Eventually, it will serve as a **companion AI** that knows *you*, adapts with you, and evolves to support your unique growth arc.

## 🛠 Current Status

This is the **early-stage framework**, serving as a working prototype and proof of concept.  
I’m currently:

- Defining interaction flows and journaling architecture
- Mapping ideal user states and voice tone guidance
- Prototyping with my own real entries to fine-tune resonance
- Exploring decentralized, privacy-focused storage options

Open to collaboration, feedback, or aligned contributors.
