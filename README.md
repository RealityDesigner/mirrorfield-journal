# Mirrorfield Journal

A self-reflective AI journaling tool designed to help users grow mentally, emotionally, and neurologically through guided interaction and self-awareness. Built for the decentralized future.

## Why It Matters
Most digital tools pull attention outwardâ€”Mirrorfield guides users inward. It's born from lived ADHD experience and blends somatic reflection, neurodivergence, and adaptive journaling logic.

## Current Status
This repo is in early development. The README, roadmap, and journal prompts are actively evolving. Feedback and collaborators are welcome.

## Features (Planned)
- Dynamic journaling templates
- Somatic & cognitive prompt logic
- Offline-first architecture
- IPFS & decentralized storage integration

## Vision
To create a daily-use tool for nervous system literacy, emotional resilience, and intentional reality design.
