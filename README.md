# Mirrorfield: A Consciousness-Driven AI Journaling System

**Mirrorfield** is a decentralized, self reflective journaling system powered by LLMs that helps users grow mentally, emotionally, and neurologically through guided interaction and self awareness.

This project was born from lived experience with ADHD and neurodivergence, designed to offer emotionally intelligent guidance to the average person. Mirrorfield is part AI, part mirror, and part map guiding users through a healing process while collecting zero user data.

This repository will be updated in real time during development. For now, it serves as a conceptual staging ground and demonstration of the projectâ€™s architecture and intention.

**Core principles:**
- Built for everyday humans
- Emotionally intelligent, non-prescriptive design
- Decentralized, privacy first architecture
- Aligned with regenerative systems and open collaboration

> This repo is part of a funding application through the Ethereum Foundation ESP. If accepted, full development will begin with transparent documentation and iteration.
